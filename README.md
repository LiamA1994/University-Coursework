# University-Coursework
This is some experience and information on the e-portolio I had to create in one of my courses throughout university.

As you can see, the web-pages have been created and do show additional comments and screenshots of my code. This is just a quick README file to give a little more additional notes on my work.

Each link for this portfolio was designed based on a coursework specification handed to myself by my lecturer and teacher for that semester.
